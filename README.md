# local-notification-demo

In this demo, you will learn how to schedule local notifications in Swift. To achieve this, we used the framework called 'UserNotifications'.

This demo includes:

- Default local notifications with Time Interval, Location and Calendar.

- Notifications with attachments, you can attach media files like Image, Audio, Video, GIF etc.

- Add your own actions with the Notification preview and perform any tasks on trigger an action.

- Notification with Custom UI. Yes, you can add your custom UI also in notification preview using "UNNotificationContentExtension".
